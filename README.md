# The Treeme

Just an effort to customize my vscode in my free time.
The theme is initially inspired by "carbon" theme of monkeytype and "monokai pro spectrum".

It's a collections of themes based on colors of trees!

## themes
- orange tree (dark theme)
- apple tree (dark theme)
- lemon tree (dark theme)
- cherry blossom (light theme)
- cherry blossom in the night (dark theme)

# notes
might plan to add more if I got bored with my theme or recieved an interesting idea.
